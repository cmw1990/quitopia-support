## Chrome Console Checker

The Chrome Console Checker is a powerful tool that connects to Chrome's remote debugging protocol to capture and display console errors in real-time. This is especially useful for debugging client-side issues that may not be apparent from build logs.

### Usage

Simply run the provided shell script:

```bash
./check-console.sh [url]
```

This will:
1. Start Chrome with remote debugging enabled
2. Navigate to the specified URL (or default to http://localhost:5176)
3. Display all console messages, with special formatting for errors and warnings
4. Capture JavaScript exceptions with stack traces
5. Monitor network errors

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop monitoring and close Chrome.

### Example Output

```

## NRT Imports Fixer

This tool automatically fixes import errors in the NRT Directory component by analyzing the API file and ProductDetails.tsx to find the correct function names.

### Usage

1. Analyzes the `api.ts` file to find all exported functions
2. Identifies the missing imports in `ProductDetails.tsx`
3. Uses pattern matching to find the best replacement for each missing import
4. Updates the imports in `ProductDetails.tsx` automatically
5. Reports the changes and confidence level for each replacement

### Example Output

```
üîç Analyzing NRT Directory files to fix import errors...

Detected missing imports: getVendors, getCountryInfo, trackAffiliateClick

Proposed replacements:
- getVendors ‚Üí fetchVendors (Confidence: 100%)
- getCountryInfo ‚Üí getCountryData (Confidence: 75%)
- trackAffiliateClick ‚Üí recordAffiliateClick (Confidence: 80%)

‚úÖ ProductDetails.tsx has been updated with corrected imports!

To verify the changes, run:
npm run dev
```
