  - [ ] Implement step tracking integration with device APIs

These immediate next steps will bring the application to a 100% production-ready state, ensuring all components are error-free and adhering to the SSOT8001 guidelines.

## Type Error Resolution Plan

We've identified 238 TypeScript errors across 41 files. Our systematic approach to resolve these:

1. **Error Categories and Resolution Approach**:
   
   **A. API Call Method Errors (48 errors)**
   - Replace all instance of .order(), .eq(), .gte() with direct REST API calls
   - Update query parameter construction to use URL parameters instead of chained methods
   - Example fix pattern:
     ```typescript
     // FROM:
     const result = supabase
       .from('table_name')
       .select('*')
       .order('timestamp', { ascending: false });
     
     // TO: 
     const endpoint = `/rest/v1/table_name?select=*&order=timestamp.desc`;
     const result = await authenticatedRestCall(endpoint, {
       method: 'GET'
     }, session);
     ```

   **B. Component Property Type Errors (72 errors)**
   - Fix Recharts component property types (tickFormatter, Label position)
   - Correct UI component prop type mismatches
   - Add proper type declarations for missing properties
   - Create type adapters where API types don't match component types

   **C. Object Property Access Errors (63 errors)**
   - Fix property access on API response objects
   - Update type definitions to match actual API responses
   - Add proper type guards and null checks

   **D. Missing Import Errors (32 errors)**
   - Fix or create missing exports in API files
   - Update imports to use correct module paths
   - Create missing type definitions

   **E. Function Parameter Errors (23 errors)**
   - Update function calls to pass correct parameters
   - Fix function signature mismatches
   - Add proper default values and optional parameters

2. **Resolution Priority by Component**:
   1. HolisticDashboard (21 errors)
   2. HealthImprovementTimeline (18 errors)
   3. StepRewards (14 errors)
   4. Progress & ProductDetail (29 errors)
   5. UI Components (8 errors)
   6. Remaining components (42 files)

3. **Testing Approach**:
   - After fixing each component, run TypeScript type checking on that file
   - Verify that component renders correctly after fixes
   - Test component functionality to ensure behavior hasn't changed
   - Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases

By following this structured approach, we'll systematically eliminate all TypeScript errors, ensuring code quality and maintainability while reducing runtime errors.
