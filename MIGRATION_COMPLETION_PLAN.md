# API Migration Completion Plan

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Fix FocusTracker.tsx Linter Errors
- Address the variable definition for setFocusTrends
- Fix type issues with string[] indexing
- Add missing properties to FocusLog type definition
- Estimated time: 1-2 hours

### 2. Manual GuidesHub.tsx Update
- Use the reference in GuidesHub.tsx.new to update the main component file
- The main changes needed:
  - Change import from supabase to supabaseRestCall from missionFreshApiClient
  - Update the loadGuides function to use proper REST API format
- Estimated time: 30 minutes

### 3. Update supabase/client.ts
- Rewrite client.ts to use missionFreshApiClient.ts instead
- Ensure backward compatibility for any components not yet migrated
- Implement signUp function using REST API calls
- Estimated time: 1 hour

### 4. Testing
- Test all components to ensure they work with the new API implementation
- Focus on:
  - Authentication flows
  - Data fetching in all components
  - Form submissions and data updates
  - Error handling across components
- Estimated time: 3-4 hours

### 5. Documentation
- Update API documentation to reflect the new REST API approach
- Document common patterns for using supabaseRestCall
- Create examples for typical operations (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
- Estimated time: 2 hours

## Timeline
Total estimated time: 8-10 hours

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit test each component with the new API implementation
2. Integration testing across components
3. End-to-end testing of critical user flows
4. Performance testing to ensure the new API approach doesn't introduce latency

## Fallback Plan
If any component fails after migration:
1. Identify the specific API call causing the issue
2. Create a temporary compatibility layer if needed
3. Fix the implementation without reverting to the old approach

## Final Checks
- Ensure all Supabase client imports are removed
- Verify consistent error handling across components
- Confirm API calls follow the REST convention
- Check for proper loading state management in all components
