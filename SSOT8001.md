| React | 18.2.0 | Core UI library |
| Vite | 4.4.11 | Build tool and dev server |
| Tailwind CSS | 3.3.3 | Utility-first CSS framework |
| TypeScript | 5.0.2 | Static typing for JavaScript |
| Node.js | 18.16.1 | Runtime environment |

| Zod | 3.22.2 | Schema validation |
| Shadcn UI | Latest | UI component library based on Radix UI |

## Code Quality Standards

1. **TypeScript Usage**: 
   - All new code must be written in TypeScript
   - Explicit type definitions for function parameters, return values, and state
   - Avoid use of `any` type unless absolutely necessary

2. **Component Architecture**:
   - Functional components with hooks
   - Props should be typed with interfaces
   - Components should have single responsibility
   - Break down large components into smaller, reusable ones

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement proper error boundaries
   - Add loading states for async operations
   - Provide user-friendly error messages

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - All components must be responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Use Tailwind breakpoints consistently (sm, md, lg, xl)
   - Test UI on multiple screen sizes

5. **Accessibility**:
   - Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards
   - Use semantic HTML elements
   - Ensure proper keyboard navigation
   - Include appropriate ARIA attributes

6. **Performance**:
   - Lazy loading for routes and large components
   - Optimize re-renders with memoization
   - Keep bundle size minimal
   - Use code splitting where appropriate

## Progress Metrics

| Metric | Current Status | Target |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| TypeScript Errors | 175 errors in 39 files | 0 errors |
| Component Documentation | 60% | 100% |
| Test Coverage | 45% | 80% |
| Accessibility Compliance | 70% | 95% |
| Build Performance | 45s | <30s |
| Code Duplication | 15% | <5% |
| Type-safety Coverage | 75% | 98% |

## Recent Enhancements

1. **Fixed Type Issues in Components**:
   - Added proper type checking in `HealthImprovementTimeline` component for organ system identification and wellness score calculations
   - Fixed timestamp handling in `HolisticDashboard` component by adding null checks before using in `new Date()` constructor
   - Improved component return type in `HolisticDashboard` to properly return JSX.Element
   - Fixed type issues in `ReportPreview` component for array data handling
   - Fixed import paths in `App.tsx` to correctly match component file locations
   - Added proper session props to components in router configuration

2. **Documentation Improvements**:
   - Created comprehensive SSOT8001 document outlining development standards
   - Updated SSOT5001 with current progress metrics and completion percentages
   - Documented ongoing TypeScript error resolution progress

3. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Added null checks for timestamps throughout the application
   - Improved type safety in data processing functions
   - Enhanced error handling for API responses

## Current Focus Areas

1. **TypeScript Error Resolution**:
   - Addressing remaining 175 errors in 39 files (reduced from 182 errors)
   - Prioritizing errors in `PrivateMessaging` component related to type parameters in API calls
   - Fixing property access issues in `ReportPreview` component
   - Resolving interface issues in the `OrderManager` and `ProductDetail` components
   - Fixing remaining prop type mismatches across components

2. **API Consistency**:
   - Standardizing API response types
   - Correcting type parameters in `authenticatedRestCall` function usage
   - Fixing type mismatches in REST and Supabase calls
   - Adding missing type declarations for API responses

3. **Component Structure**:
   - Reducing code duplication across similar components
   - Breaking down large components into smaller, manageable pieces
   - Ensuring consistent prop types across related components

4. **Fixed API Issues**:
   - Resolving missing exports in `apiCompatibility.ts`
   - Correcting function parameter types for API calls
   - Adding proper type guards for API responses

## Development Workflow

1. **New Features**:
   - Create feature branch from `l1-essentials`
   - Implement with proper TypeScript types
   - Add tests covering core functionality
   - Submit PR with detailed description

2. **Code Reviews**:
   - Verify TypeScript compliance
   - Check for responsive design
   - Ensure accessibility requirements are met
   - Validate API usage patterns

3. **Design System**:
   - All UI components should use Shadcn UI when possible
   - Follow established color scheme and spacing system
   - Maintain consistent component API patterns

## Build and Deployment

1. **Local Development**:
   - Use `npm run dev` for development server
   - Run `npm run build` to verify no TypeScript errors before commit

2. **Production Build**:
   - Use `npm run build` to generate production-ready assets
   - Validate bundle size and performance

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - GitHub Actions for automated testing
   - Vercel for preview deployments
   - AWS for production hosting

This document will be updated as new standards are established or existing ones are revised. All team members are expected to adhere to these standards for consistent, high-quality code.
