# Mission Fresh API Migration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the migration from direct Supabase client method calls to REST API calls per the SSOT8001 requirements. The project currently has two API client implementations:

1. `supabase-client.ts` - The original REST API implementation
2. `missionFreshApiClient.ts` - The newer, more comprehensive REST API implementation

Both files implement REST API calls following SSOT8001 guidelines. The plan is to gradually migrate all components to use `missionFreshApiClient.ts` exclusively.

## Components Updated

The following components have been updated to use `missionFreshApiClient.ts`:

- ✅ `ConsumptionLogger.tsx` - Updated `handleDelete` and `updateLog` functions to use `supabaseRestCall`
- ✅ `BreathingGame.tsx` - Updated imports and `saveGameProgress` function
- ✅ `MemoryCards.tsx` - Updated imports for `supabaseRestCall`
- ✅ `syncHealthData` function in `missionFreshApiClient.ts` - Revised to handle the specific parameters from `ConsumptionLogger`

## Components Pending Update

The following components still need to be updated to use `missionFreshApiClient.ts`:

- ❌ `GameAchievements.tsx` - Currently imports from `supabase-client.ts`
- ❌ `FocusTracker.tsx` - Currently imports from `supabase-client.ts`
- ❌ `EnergyTracker.tsx` - Currently imports from `supabase-client.ts`
- ❌ `GuidesHub.tsx` - Currently imports `supabase` from `supabase-client.ts`
- ❌ `ProductDetail.tsx` - Currently imports `supabase` from `supabase-client.ts`
- ❌ `Community.tsx` - Currently imports `supabase` from `supabase-client.ts`
- ❌ `Settings.tsx` - Currently imports `supabase` from `supabase-client.ts`
- ❌ `AuthProvider.tsx` - Currently imports multiple functions from `supabase-client.ts`
- ❌ `Achievements.tsx` - Currently imports `supabase` from `supabase-client.ts`

## Migration Strategy

1. Review each component listed under "Pending Update"
2. Update imports to use `missionFreshApiClient.ts`
3. Ensure any component-specific functionality is properly implemented in `missionFreshApiClient.ts`
4. Test each updated component to ensure functionality is maintained
5. Once all components are migrated, consider deprecating `supabase-client.ts`

## External Dependencies to Update

- `useSession.ts` hook - Currently imports from `supabase-client.ts`
- `client.ts` in the `supabase` lib directory - Currently imports from `supabase-client.ts`
- `router.tsx` - Currently imports `getCurrentSession` from `supabase-client.ts`

## Notes

- `supabase-client.ts` and `missionFreshApiClient.ts` both follow SSOT8001 guidelines and use direct REST API calls
- The main goal is to consolidate all API access through `missionFreshApiClient.ts` for consistency
- `SupabaseTest.tsx` is a test component and may not need to be updated as it explicitly tests both approaches
