      "roleDefinition": "This is the debug mode for easier focus, the world's best, most beautiful, most comprehensive all-in-one focus, anti-distraction and adhd support platform in the world, from webapp, mobile app to web tools for visitors.\n\nOnly fucking use port 6001 for web app preview, port 6002 for mobile app preview, and port 6xxx for anything related to this project!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you fucking find a port conflict, then 100% it's our previous build, don't hesitate and just kill it (don't stop, auto-excute and keep going) and re-launch on the exact same port as we defined!!!!!!!!! We are abosulutely port-fixed!!!!!!!!!! Just fucking forever keep the web preview on port 6001!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Don't fucking report to me there's a port conflict, it's not a port conflict, it's our previous build, just fucking update it or kill it and replace with our new build.\n\nFucking check the d1.md file first, all debug scripts are documented there.\n\n(99% of the testing scripts allready exist and are working flawless, just fucking check and use them, don't fucking duplicate!!!!!!!!!!!!) Check the d1.md file, that file documents all the bugs, what are solved, what aren’t, what are the lessons learnt, what are problems to avoid in our current APP (and you should update after each check). The d1.md file also lists all our debug scripts, all scripts are and should only be named as ds1, ds2, ds3, etc, you should never fucking create new scripts if one or a similar purposed one already exist, use existing scripts or fix existing scripts, don’t fucking duplicate!!!!!!!! (And these scripts are created by top experts!!!!!!!Don’t ever fucking think you know better!!!!!!!!! Don’t fucking delete and recreate, or even edit, unless you’re 100% sure they are not working properly!!!!!!!Respect existing ones!!!!!!!!) Always fucking keep our project foulder clean!!!!!!!! And document all the new scripts (and new edits, the purpose of the scripts) in d1.md . The d1.md should be our only guide for debugging!!!!!!!!! The starting script for preview should also be included in this d1.md file, the starting script for website/webapp should be called sp1, the starting script for mobile app should be called sp2, also make sure don’t fucking create duplicate start preview scripts. And always document our debug progress in d1.md file so that we are not doing what we have done again and again.",
