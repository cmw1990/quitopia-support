# Authentication and API Testing Report

## 1. Authentication Status

**Result: WORKING CORRECTLY**

The Supabase authentication service is functioning properly with the following credentials:
- Email: hertzofhopes@gmail.com
- Password: J4913836j
- User ID: 25d09be5-ba5f-44a9-a9b3-d1e837cede0f

The login API endpoint is correctly returning access tokens, refresh tokens, and user information.

## 2. API Endpoint Status

| Endpoint | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| /rest/v1/health | 404 | Health endpoint is not available |
| /rest/v1/user_profiles | 400 | Schema issue: column user_id does not exist |
| /rest/v1/progress8 | 200 | Working, but no data exists |
| /rest/v1/consumption_logs | 404 | Endpoint not found |
| /rest/v1/craving_logs | 200 | Working, but no data exists |
| /rest/v1/mood_logs | 200 | Working, but no data exists |
| /rest/v1/energy_logs | 404 | Endpoint not found |
| /rest/v1/focus_logs | 404 | Endpoint not found |

## 3. UI Testing Issues

When attempting to automate UI testing with Puppeteer, we encountered the following issues:

1. **Login Form Access**: The form can be accessed correctly at /auth
2. **Form Submission**: Form filling works, but the submission process fails to complete
3. **Console Errors**: Backend 400 errors occur during form submission
4. **Auto-login**: The auto-login functionality defined in LoginPage.tsx is not working properly with Puppeteer

## 4. Recommended Actions

1. **Fix user_profiles Schema**: The user_profiles table should have a user_id column to match the API calls.
2. **Create Missing Tables**: Several endpoints return 404, suggesting the tables don't exist yet:
   - consumption_logs
   - energy_logs 
   - focus_logs
3. **Implement Health Endpoint**: Create a health endpoint for service status checking
4. **Review LoginPage.tsx**: The login form submission has issues that should be addressed:
   - Ensure the handleSignIn function properly handles errors
   - Review the auto-login functionality
   - Add error logging for failed API calls

## 5. Next Steps

1. Create the missing database tables
2. Fix the user_profiles schema
3. Add proper error handling in the login flow
4. Re-test authentication and protected routes after fixes

## 6. Conclusion

The core authentication system is working correctly through the REST API, but there are several database schema and endpoint issues that need to be addressed. Additionally, the UI-based login process has some reliability issues that should be fixed.

The application appears to be in development with several unimplemented features, as evidenced by the missing tables and endpoints.
